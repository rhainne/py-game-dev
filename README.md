Repository to hold all my progress with the book Beginning Python Games Development, 2nd Edition by Harrison Kinsley and Will McGugan.

Thie repository also contains a couple of simple games that help to check the structure of a finished game:
- A version of the classic Tetris, made by Laria Carolin Chabowski
- A simple text based RPG made by Francesco Balducci
