# Python Game Development

Repository to hold all my progress with the book Beginning Python Games Development, 2nd Edition by Harrison Kinsley and Will McGugan.

This repository also contains a couple of simple games that help to check the structure of a finished game:
- A version of the classic Tetris, made by Laria Carolin Chabowski
- A simple text based RPG made by Francesco Balducci

I will develop some little scripts to implement the lessons I learn and could be usefull in the future to make little games.
- Classic movement of a sprite to the target using rotation and direction from source to target(mouse position)
- Precalculation of direction vectors in key_vector_movement.py script (Done in key_vector_mvmnt_opt.py)
- Implement an inventory and item grabbing function
